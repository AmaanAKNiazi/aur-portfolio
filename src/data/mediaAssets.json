This kind of demarcation and discrimination also poses a potential threat to the State’. SC directs governments to prepare a bill for provision of inexpensive, low cost housing and social housing for the inhabitants of slum areas and shelterless people to be tabled before the Parliament and Provincial Assemblies, with a fixed timeframe and tentative budget. SC further directs the government to appoint a commission consisting of housing experts Tasneem Siddiqui and Arif Hasan to oversee this process.",
