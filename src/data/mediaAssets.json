It is a common practice by CDA to visit abadi and locate any new construction and destroy it so that abadi does not flourish further in size and population. People inside and outside abadi too, keep on informing CDA about such new constructions in abadi. This also has made these people sort of resilient and fearless. People living in the abadi are called “qabza mafia” by the people living outside nearby regular colonies. Not all respondents were politically engaged or participated actively in incidents of demolishing the houses in abadi in the past. James' shop and one room were demolished last year in winter but they did not resist CDA out of fear of eviction. They knew that their silence would cause less harm to their living in that abadi."

        "Hundreds of progressive political workers, intellectuals, youth and affectees of ‘development’ projects from all over the country gathered for two successive days at the Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai Community Centre in Islamabad for the first ‘People’s Conference on Land, Ecology, Development and Displacement’. The conference brought to light the increasing incidence of violent dispossession taking place under the guise of ‘development’ in both peripheral regions and major Pakistani cities, and the increasing control of state-backed mafias on land and other natural resources at the cost of indigenous communities and working masses.",
        "Eight sessions took place over the two-day conference, ranging from discussions over global finance and real estate, to the state of exhausted resource peripheries and the imperative of housing for working-class residents of metropolitan areas in the face of ever proliferating gated housing schemes. Amongst the prominent speakers present on the occasion were ex Director General of the Sindh Katchi Abadi Authority, Tasneem Siddiqui; President of the Gwadar Fishermen Alliance, Khudadad Waju; Dr. Majed Akhter of King’s College London; and Director of the Institute of Business Administration, Dr. Akbar Zaidi.",
        "AWP leaders Ammar Rashid, Alia Amirali, Khurram Ali, Hafeez Baloch, and Aasim Sajjad shared their experiences of organising local communities from Karachi to Islamabad against mass evictions. They asserted that whether dispossession is enforced by the state, and where it entities like Bahria Town are in the lead, repression against those who engage in peaceful resistance to defend their homes and lands is commonplace and intensifying. AWP organisers resisting eviction of katchi abadis in Karachi’s Gujjar Nala and Orangi Nala areas have been jailed repeatedly, while Seengar Noonari, who has been on the frontline of resistance to the forced capture of villages for the expansion of Bahria Town was forcibly disappeared two weeks ago.",
        "Legal experts like environmental lawyer Ahmed Rafay Alam and SIRA and Karachi Bachao Tehreek’s legal advisor Abira Ashfaq as well as urban planners like Ayesha Shahid noted the use of colonial era laws like the Land Acquisition Act (1894) to dispossess villagers and katchi abadi residents alike. They questioned the role of the superior judiciary in fulfilling its constitutional mandate of protecting the rights of the most vulnerable. They also criticised massive development initiatives like the Ravi Riverfront City and Rawalpindi Ring Road which are both ecologically destructive and generating mass displacement. Fayyaz Gilani of the Rawalpindi Ring Road Affectees committee and Akmal Riaz of the Dadhocha Dam Affectees committee also shared their experiences of being forced to sell agricultural lands at throwaway rates for mega-projects announced without them being consulted.",
        "Sibt-ul-Hasan and Nazimuddin Salarzai shared how disputes over land are intensifying in the ex FATA districts in the shadow of the war on terror and the multifarious devastation caused by the latter. These disputes are exacerbating sectarian and other conflicts due to the flawed strategic policies of the state. Hashim Khoso and Nausheen Anwar discussed similar resource-based disputes in the context of Sindh, especially in the urban metropolis of Karachi. They warned that control over land in Karachi is continually conflated with ethnic identity, with potentially even more explosive consequences than have been experienced in the past.",
        "In the session on Islamabad, PIDE economist Dr. Zia Bandey shared insights on the exploitation of street vendors, most of them displaced migrant workers, in the informal economy of the city and spoke of the importance of licensing them and providing them basic economic rights. Hydrology expert Dr. Hassan Abbas spoke of the unsustainable, dam-reliant water management practices used by government in the Islamabad region and stressed on the need to sustainably utilized natural aquifers and monsoon rains for the city’s water needs.",
        "The conference resolution noted that the politics of land and other natural resources is more important today than even in the past and called for a series of wide-ranging steps for rural and urban land reform, including redistribution, review of the land acquisition act, taxation of large and under-utilized landholdings, implementation of incremental public housing and regularization of katchi abadis, among other aspects.",
        "Today’s increasingly financialised model of ‘development’ is generating more surplus populations than ever before as profiteering through speculative real estate is considered far more important than the current or future welfare of millions of working people who previously used land and other natural resources to secure basic livelihoods. The need for a land reform agenda in the 21st century prefacing the wellbeing of working people and the natural environment is, therefore, extremely urgent."

      "description": "This report maps and analyzes the precarious state of low-income housing in Islamabad, where nearly a quarter of the population lives in katchi abadis (informal settlements). It highlights how the Capital Development Authority’s (CDA) land-use policies, demolitions, and refusal to recognize these settlements have entrenched cycles of eviction, displacement, and marginalization. The study argues that Islamabad’s urban planning prioritizes elite real estate development at the expense of workers and vulnerable populations, creating a permanent state of impermanence for the city’s poor.",

        "The report finds that over 532,000 people (23% of Islamabad’s population) live in 39 katchi abadis, most of which are unrecognised and under constant threat of demolition. These communities largely house marginalized groups—Christian sanitation workers, Pashtun and Afghan migrants, and displaced rural poor—who provide essential services to the city.",
        "Despite residents investing heavily in housing through informal markets, they face extortion, lack of infrastructure, and recurring forced evictions. The CDA, instead of creating affordable housing policies, has perpetuated insecurity by denying recognition of settlements, ignoring Supreme Court orders, and privileging elite encroachments while criminalizing poor communities.",
        "The report concludes by calling for recognition of katchi abadis, formalization of tenure, and a rights-based housing policy that ensures justice-driven urban development."

      "Alliance for Urban Rights (AUR) is an action-based research and advocacy organization constituted in August 2019, to fill the gap between activism and research. Our work lies at the intersections of urban planning, climate, gender justice, and technology.",
      "We work with communities impacted by urban displacement & violence especially the gendered impacts of it. AUR is a network of activists, organisers and researchers, who work on issues of marginality and rights.",
      "<strong>Previous Projects</strong>",
      "In our previous project we worked in collaboration with All Pakistan Alliance for Katchi Abadis in Islamabad (working since 2003), to explore possibilities and provide alternative policy discourse to the State provided narrative with respect to low income housing, which not only fails to address the fundamental needs of the people living in the ever growing low-income informal housing.",
      "The aim of AUR is to improve the welfare of residents of irregular settlements by investing in, developing and strengthening related infrastructures of care, and in equipping vulnerable communities with the necessary knowledge, skills and capabilities. The purpose is to develop alternative knowledge on vulnerable communities- one that highlights their central role as hardworking, responsible citizens who live in ethical and sustainable communities.",
      "Objectives",
      "1) To conduct research studies on the socio- economic conditions of people living in irregular settlements with a view to involving ways and means for their development within and beyond their social historical frame works and to seek promotion of urban development such as provision of right to shelter, drinking water and education as well as Public Convenience for people.",
      "2) Disseminating information about past and present government policies, actions and initiatives.",
      "3) Establish a dialogue about the economic, social and political power structures that exist in the country and beyond.",
      "4) Raising awareness about the political and legal rights of the Abadi residents, as slum-dwellers and citizens of Pakistan.",
      "5) Outlining the need for peaceful social, political and community organization beyond religious, sectarian, ethnic and gender differences.",
      "6) The association seeks to influence government decision-making through protests, organized demonstrations and legal claims. Its current agenda involves organizing a rally on land rights.",
      "7) To communicate and coordinate with the Govt. Local and public authorities on various issues related to development welfare and public interest on different subjects. –due to ineffective policy and implementation-but also keeps the population living in these settlements at a very vulnerable dis empowered position in the mainstream societal and economic stratum."
